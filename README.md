I‚Äôm currently working as a backend, frontend and devops developer. I have had the opportunity to participate in several projects, such as the development of payment issuance systems, the adaptation of applications to new business logic, the creation of new functionalities for administration systems in the field of health, access control of personnel to work facilities, the analysis, design and development of new products, the creation of a system for personnel management and payroll payment, the creation of an accounting system, the implementation of a platform for the management of payments in university systems and consultation of student account status. In addition, I have participated in the banking interconnection between the payment platform and the bank, I have developed architectures and I have created an application for cell phones that allows the consultation of three-dimensional multimedia files. I have also had the opportunity to create applications for automatic notification sending and real estate management, develop and implement application programming interfaces (API) for task management, work on laboratory platforms, participate in real estate projects, migrate servers and resizing images for file servers, rebuilding projects, and working in estate planning systems. Additionally, I have provided support in the creation of continuous deployment (CI/CD), the configuration of development and production environments for new platforms, the design and creation of databases, the interconnection of web applications with cloud services for the payment and email management, the use of object storage services, web servers, monitoring services, authentication, SQL and NoSQL databases, and marketing platforms. I have also participated in the implementation of agile methodologies in the development of projects, such as Spiral, Extreme Programming (XP), Scrum, ‚Äúshape up‚Äù and "repository pattern", which has allowed greater efficiency and adaptability in the development process
